          Despite the important role these spaces play in the well being of New Yorkers, the average city park last saw a major renovation in 1997. According to the Center for an Urban Future, these spaces are starting to show their age — an issue
          that has been compounded by the visitor increase and a 14% cut to the Department of Parks and Recreation budget.
        </p>

        <p>
          Charisse Hill, press officer for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, says that the department has been underfunded for years. According to her, this year’s budget cut has made their work more difficult, but staff are doing
          their best.

        </p>
        <p>
          "This crisis has made it strikingly clear that parks are critical to the infrastructure of our city," Hill said. "Despite the unforeseen circumstances brought forth by the pandemic, our staff remains committed to maintaining parks for the
          health and safety of New Yorkers."
